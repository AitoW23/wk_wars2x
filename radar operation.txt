Process:
 - Run the custom ray trace function to check bounding boxes
 - Collect all of the hit vehicles in a table (RADAR.vars.capturedVehicles)
   - Priority goes to the vehicle which fits the set direction mode (fwd/bwd) and the set radar mode (fastest/biggest)
 - Loop through the vehicle table and grab the one that fits the above mentioned modes
 - Display the chosen vehicle's speed in the radar

Checks:
 - Vehicle must be moving faster than 1.0 (units)
 - Vehicle is not the player's vehicle
 - Vehicle is a car, motorcycle, or a quadbike 

Possible TODO:
 - Create a system that stores bounding box data of models in a table so that the system doesn't have to create new data for models that have been previously caught by the radar

 Development notes:
 - Set the radiusSqr to be based on vehicle class
